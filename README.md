# ESP32xPS3
This Repository will show you how to build a Bluetooth-controlled robot car using an ESP32 microcontroller and a PS3 controller. By doing this project, you’ll learn about electronics, programming, and robotics, and you’ll also get a head start on your college team’s next robotics event.

In the exciting world of college robotics competitions, precision and quick thinking are key. Whether you’re ready for a thrilling robot race or a strategic game of robo-soccer, the right control system can make all the difference. While mobile phone apps and drone controllers are convenient, they often have limitations like slow response times, poor accuracy, and lack of durability.

This project shows you why using a PS3 controller to control an ESP32-powered robot car is a great idea. PS3 controllers are a well-known gaming device that has many advantages:

Low Latency:PS3 controllers are designed for real-time gaming, so you won’t have to wait long for your actions to be reflected in the robot’s movements. This is especially important in fast-paced competitions where quick decisions can make a big difference.
Comfort and Precision: The PS3 controller has a familiar layout and provides good tactile feedback, making it easy to control the robot. The analog sticks are precise, so you can easily navigate obstacles and execute moves with accuracy.
Durability: PS3 controllers are built to last and are usually more durable than mobile phones or drone controllers, so you don’t have to worry about them breaking during the competition.
Affordability:PS3 controllers are easy to find and not too expensive, so they’re a good option for college robotics teams.
